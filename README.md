# WaterQualityQuickView_GEE_Colab
QuickWater provides quick retrieval of water quality over inland waters based on the Google Earth Engine platform (GEE). It currently allows custom time and range queries and supports different satellite missions including Landsat-8 OLI, Landsat-9 OLI2, Sentinel-2A MSI, and Sentinel-2B MSI. For atmospheric correction, the default products used for calculating bio-optical parameters are surface reflectance products from GEE and QuickWater also supports ACOLITE hybrid to do atmospheric correction.

Missions:
-Landsat-8 OLI
-Landsat-9 OLI2
-Sentinel-2A MSI
-Sentinel-2B MSI

Atmospheric correction:
•	Surface reflectance product
•	ACOLITE

Water quality parameters:
•	Chlorophyll-a concentration 
•	Total solid sediment
•	Colored dissolved organic matter
